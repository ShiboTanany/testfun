Project TestFun - JEE JUnit Testing Is Fun
==========================================
Project TestFun's goal is to eliminate the common excuse for lack of good unit tests: "testing was too complicated".

TestFun-JEE is mixing existing libraries with our own goodies to deliver a robust but simple JEE junit experience which includes:
* **Injection of EJBs** (stateless sessions, singletons) and resources (JPA's entity manager, JDBC data-source, session-context) directly into JUnit test classes.
* **Injection of [Mockito](http://code.google.com/p/mockito/) mocks** into EJBs.
* **Transparent JDBC and JPA setup** - all is needed is a persistence.xml file.
